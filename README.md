# regex_dataset

Here is the github for the paper "Positive Unlabeled Learning and Positional Byte Pair Encoding for Automatic Regular Expression Generation with Near-human Performance". We share our dataset for regex generation from samples, including 8 types of data:
- Android Id
- Chinese ID numbers
- Email
- IMEI
- IPv4
- MAC
- Chinese mobile
- Chinese Plate Number

We use Generex to generate positive samples based on human-written regexes while preserving personal privacy. 

Currently, our data is going through the companyâ€™s data disclosure approval process, and we will update our database once the approval is passed.
